HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are fundamental technologies used in web development to create and design the structure and appearance of web pages. They work together but serve different purposes:

1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):

HTML is a markup language that defines the structure and content of a web page. It consists of a series of elements or tags that enclose content and provide information about its meaning. HTML elements are represented by tags enclosed in angle brackets (< and >).
Key points about HTML:
Defines the structure of a web page.
Uses tags to mark up elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.
Provides the foundation for organizing content on a webpage.

2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

CSS is a style sheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It allows developers to define the visual appearance of elements, such as fonts, colors, spacing, and positioning, without altering the underlying HTML structure.
Key points about CSS:
Controls the styling and layout of HTML elements.
Selectors are used to target HTML elements for styling.
Can be included in an HTML document using the <style> tag or in a separate CSS file linked to the HTML document.
In summary, HTML defines the structure and content of a web page, while CSS defines its presentation and style. They work together to create visually appealing and well-organized web pages. Modern web development often involves using additional technologies such as JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. The combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript forms the core technologies for building dynamic and interactive websites.
